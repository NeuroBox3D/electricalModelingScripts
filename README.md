# electricalModeling
UG4 app providing Lua scripts for a quantitative comparison of various models
for electrical signal processing in neurons.

The models include the classic (1D) cable equation, a 3D generalization thereof,
as well as a full 3D electro-diffusion model (Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations)
and a 1D specialization thereof.

The models and simulations carried out with the scripts of this repository
are described in detail in a publication
"The necessary modeling detail for neuronal signaling: 
Poisson-Nernst-Planck and cable equation models in 1D and 3D"
accepted for publication in SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics.
